fight\n00:00:05 against cyber attacks it's fascinating\n00:00:08 yeah absolutely it's really impressive\n00:00:10 so we're talking about a tool that\n00:00:12 brings fishing reporting right into\n00:00:14 outlooks ribbon correct exactly with\n00:00:16 keep Net's fishing reporter button in\n00:00:18 the Outlook ribbon employees can report\n00:00:21 fishing emails with a single click this\n00:00:24 instant reporting directs the suspicious\n00:00:26 email to Microsoft Defender and keep\n00:00:29 Net's incident respon\n00:00:30 that oneclick action dramatically speeds\n00:00:33 up threat detection right it removes the\n00:00:36 hassle of manual forwarding which is\n00:00:38 typically a barrier yes absolutely the\n00:00:41 speed is key here fishing is one of the\n00:00:43 biggest entry points for cyber attacks\n00:00:46 with um 91% of attacks starting from\n00:00:48 fishing emails Yeah by making reporting\n00:00:51 so effortless it overcomes the inaction\n00:00:54 that alarmingly many employees exhibit\n00:00:56 and it's not just about speed the button\n00:00:59 remains visible in the ribbon\n00:01:01 continuously reminding users to be\n00:01:03 vigilant that constant visibility seems\n00:01:05 like a game changer right because\n00:01:07 visibility equals a built-in reminder\n00:01:09 every time someone checks their email\n00:01:11 it's like uh it's like having a little\n00:01:14 defense coach right there always on call\n00:01:17 mhm I really like how it works across\n00:01:19 all platforms desktop web and mobile\n00:01:23 though I have to ask what about\n00:01:25 environments where the ribbon isn't\n00:01:27 available like on some mobile versions\n00:01:30 good point as of now the ribbon button\n00:01:32 isn't on Outlook mobile or the MacBook\n00:01:34 desktop version so there's a bit of a\n00:01:36 gap there but for the environments it\n00:01:37 does reach it significantly enhances\n00:01:40 security and response times so the\n00:01:42 solution essentially builds dual layers\n00:01:44 of Defense by using both Microsoft\n00:01:46 Defender and keep Nets\n00:01:48 analysis it really turns the email\n00:01:51 reporting process into a coordinated\n00:01:53 effort exactly the Dual system analysis\n00:01:56 means when an email is reported\n00:01:59 Microsoft filters it for Global threats\n00:02:02 while keepnet examines it for\n00:02:04 organization specific patterns this\n00:02:07 layered approach is what sets the system\n00:02:09 apart I'm curious about the additional\n00:02:11 features like simulation insights and\n00:02:14 admin oversight how do those work\n00:02:16 together well simulation insights are\n00:02:18 used in fishing training exercises when\n00:02:21 employees report simulated fishing\n00:02:22 emails it provides feedback about which\n00:02:25 users are actively on guard an admin\n00:02:28 oversight consolidates all reports s in\n00:02:30 a single dashboard letting security\n00:02:32 teams Act\n00:02:33 Fast mhm that integration truly bolsters\n00:02:38 both prevention and follow-up measures\n00:02:40 now it sounds like a lot of effort for a\n00:02:43 single button do you think its\n00:02:45 Simplicity might hide potential\n00:02:46 complexity behind the scenes I see what\n00:02:48 you're saying but it's actually a design\n00:02:50 strength because the button is so\n00:02:53 straightforward it encourages consistent\n00:02:55 use complexity is managed in the back\n00:02:57 end with automated layered\n00:03:01 analyses yeah that makes a lot of sense\n00:03:04 it's like uh it simplifies user behavior\n00:03:08 and reinforces a proactive security\n00:03:11 culture users get immediate confirmation\n00:03:15 with messages like great catch after\n00:03:18 reporting exactly that positive feedback\n00:03:21 loop not only strengthens awareness but\n00:03:24 also motivates employees to stay alert\n00:03:26 the impact is tangible with reported\n00:03:29 fishing attempts surging by 82% within 6\n00:03:32 months in some organizations wow those\n00:03:34 numbers really drive the point home and\n00:03:36 by reducing breach risks it potentially\n00:03:39 saves organizations hundreds of\n00:03:40 thousands if not millions in breach\n00:03:43 costs no doubt about that the\n00:03:46 cost-saving benefits are immense when\n00:03:48 you consider the potential damage of\n00:03:49 even a single breach it's a great\n00:03:52 example of how a small integrated tool\n00:03:55 can lead to huge security improvements\n00:03:57 this solution seems to truly shift the\n00:04:00 security culture empowering employees in\n00:04:03 a tool they already know and use every\n00:04:06 day absolutely keep Net's approach is\n00:04:08 more than just a button it's a step\n00:04:10 toward a proactive and resilient cyber\n00:04:13 security posture it modernizes threat\n00:04:16 reporting and capitalizes on the ease of\n00:04:18 a single click fascinating\n00:04:21 discussion it's clear that despite some\n00:04:24 limitations in platform coverage the\n00:04:26 benefits far outweigh the drawbacks\n00:04:30 thanks for breaking down these insights\n00:04:32 it's been really enlightening",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PMGH-7JQd0": "00:00:00 welcome to the podcast we're diving\n00:00:02 right into cyber security Insurance um\n00:00:05 protecting our businesses in this\n00:00:07 increasingly digital world right for\n00:00:10 sure it's crazy how cyber threats are\n00:00:11 evolving isn't it the statistics are\n00:00:13 intense absolutely you know 45% of\n00:00:16 organizations see ransomware as their\n00:00:18 top risk and uh 72% report that cyber\n00:00:22 threats have really surged in the past\n00:00:24 year yeah that's wild and let's not\n00:00:25 forget the largest IT outage in 2024\n00:00:28 caused 5 billion in losses while over $1\n00:00:31 trillion was stolen globally by cyber\n00:00:34 criminals exactly there's just so much\n00:00:36 at stake it's um like it's like a\n00:00:38 digital Battlefield out there cyber\n00:00:40 criminals are using AI powerered fishing\n00:00:43 deep fakes even ransomware as a service\n00:00:45 to uh ramp up their\n00:00:47 game mhm definitely it almost makes you\n00:00:50 wonder how do businesses really stand a\n00:00:52 chance you know where does cyber\n00:00:55 security Insurance fit into all of this\n00:00:57 well cyber security Insurance\n00:00:59 essentially is a safety net it helps um\n00:01:02 cover expenses like legal fees data\n00:01:05 restoration even the costs from business\n00:01:07 downtime after an attack got it I was\n00:01:09 reading that it even covers things like\n00:01:11 customer notifications and credit\n00:01:13 monitoring in some cases correct and\n00:01:15 policies often have two layers first\n00:01:18 party coverage for direct losses and\n00:01:20 business interruptions and third party\n00:01:22 coverage for things like legal defense\n00:01:24 and Regulatory fines yeah that makes\n00:01:26 sense but it's interesting to note that\n00:01:28 some things aren't covered\n00:01:30 like um acts of war or nation state\n00:01:34 attacks and even pre-existing\n00:01:37 vulnerabilities right and that's where\n00:01:38 businesses need to really read the fine\n00:01:40 print it's a bit uh like hiring a top\n00:01:43 chef but then not knowing which\n00:01:45 ingredients they can actually use I do\n00:01:48 Wonder though don't you think some\n00:01:50 insurers might overestimate the\n00:01:51 protection especially when only 35% of\n00:01:54 small businesses feel adequately covered\n00:01:57 I can see that point however we have to\n00:01:59 keep in mind that large organizations\n00:02:01 about 71% seem to trust their coverage\n00:02:05 but uh still there's a clear need to\n00:02:09 educate small businesses more on their\n00:02:11 risks and um on how to choose the right\n00:02:14 policy so essentially businesses should\n00:02:17 first assess their risks thoroughly\n00:02:20 including potential vulnerabilities and\n00:02:22 ensure that policy limits are robust\n00:02:24 enough to match their exposure exactly\n00:02:27 and um remember that some policies\n00:02:30 bundled with proactive tools things like\n00:02:32 vulnerability assessments and uh\n00:02:34 employee security training that\n00:02:36 proactive aspect is a huge plus speaking\n00:02:38 of training remote work seems to\n00:02:40 introduce even more risks with\n00:02:42 distributed Network\n00:02:43 vulnerabilities how are policies\n00:02:45 adapting to that great question many\n00:02:47 insurers now include um Provisions for\n00:02:50 remote workforces covering home network\n00:02:52 vulnerabilities by risks and even\n00:02:55 offering specific training modules right\n00:02:58 exactly it's fascinating how they're\n00:03:00 leveraging technology here too like\n00:03:02 using AI for underwriting and blockchain\n00:03:04 for processing claims yep it's like um\n00:03:08 turning cyber risk management into it's\n00:03:10 like a high-tech game of chess you're\n00:03:12 always one move ahead spying on what the\n00:03:15 attackers might that's a need analogy\n00:03:17 but uh don't you think that relying too\n00:03:19 much on these Tech solutions could be\n00:03:21 risky sometimes human oversight is\n00:03:23 crucial I see your point but um it's\n00:03:26 more about balance the integration of\n00:03:28 Technology enhances the process but\n00:03:30 companies still need to invest in strong\n00:03:32 security practices and continuous\n00:03:34 employee training yeah that's fair and\n00:03:37 when it comes to costs cyber insurance\n00:03:40 premiums can vary widely right small\n00:03:42 businesses might pay around ,000 to\n00:03:44 $3,000 while larger companies are paying\n00:03:46 much more Yep especially with premium\n00:03:49 increases due to escalating ransomware\n00:03:51 claims businesses with robust security\n00:03:54 can even see a reduction in costs\n00:03:57 sometimes up to\n00:03:58 20% that's smart planning ultimately\n00:04:00 despite the costs having cyber SEC\n00:04:03 Insurance seems like a must-have\n00:04:04 Safeguard against potentially crippling\n00:04:06 digital threats absolutely and as cyber\n00:04:09 attackers evolve so must our defenses\n00:04:12 cyber Insurance combined with proactive\n00:04:14 measures like penetration testing\n00:04:17 simulated fishing and regular training\n00:04:20 forms the backbone of a resilient\n00:04:21 digital\n00:04:23 strategy right indeed it's a reminder\n00:04:25 for businesses to not only ensure but\n00:04:27 also continuously improve their security\n00:04:29 posture exactly it's about staying ahead\n00:04:32 of the curve in this digital age and\n00:04:34 honestly it's a fascinating blend of\n00:04:37 Finance Tech and risk management all\n00:04:39 rolled into one really fascinating\n00:04:41 thanks for that deep dive this really\n00:04:44 sheds light on why cyber security\n00:04:45 insurance is not just an option but a\n00:04:48 necessity in today's business landscape\n00:04:50 absolutely thanks for listening and\n00:04:52 remember staying informed is staying\n00:04:54 protected",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nr2CDQUFhfI": "00:00:00 So, um, today we're diving into, uh,\n00:00:03 what they call the human risk score.\n00:00:05 Basically, a way to like measure the\n00:00:07 chance that someone's actions could lead\n00:00:08 to a cyber security mishap.\n00:00:12 Yeah, exactly. It's kind of like a\n00:00:14 credit score, but for security behavior.\n00:00:17 It takes things like fishing simulation\n00:00:19 results, password hygiene, and um,\n00:00:23 adherence to security protocols to\n00:00:25 assign a risk rating to each employee.\n00:00:28 Mhm. That makes sense, right? And you\n00:00:31 know, this isn't just for fun. It gives\n00:00:34 CISOs and IT managers a tool to pinpoint\n00:00:36 which employees are more uh likely to\n00:00:39 fall for cyber traps. Think of it as a\n00:00:42 dynamic score that updates with um real\n00:00:45 time data from fishing tests and\n00:00:47 endpoint security reports. Yep. It\n00:00:49 really brings focus to managing those\n00:00:51 human vulnerabilities. Exactly. Instead\n00:00:54 of rolling out one-sizefits-all training\n00:00:56 programs, you can actually tailor\n00:00:59 interventions. So, for example, if\n00:01:01 someone consistently falls for fishing\n00:01:03 emails, your risk score system flags\n00:01:05 them so you can provide extra training.\n00:01:08 Uh-huh. Which sounds way more efficient.\n00:01:10 And um they use all sorts of behavioral\n00:01:14 indicators, like if you're um reusing\n00:01:17 weak passwords or ignoring security\n00:01:19 patches, that ups your risk. It's it's\n00:01:23 like a wakeup call that you need to uh\n00:01:26 tighten up your security habits. Yeah,\n00:01:28 that feedback loop is crucial. Now, one\n00:01:31 intriguing aspect is how they adjust for\n00:01:33 impact modifiers. You see, not all risks\n00:01:36 are equal. A seale executive failing a\n00:01:38 fishing test might be uh weighted more\n00:01:41 heavily than a lower level employee.\n00:01:44 Mhm. So, the system really calibrates\n00:01:46 risk based on potential impact. Right.\n00:01:49 But I have to say, while this proactive\n00:01:53 approach is solid, I wonder if it might\n00:01:56 um oversimplify the human element\n00:01:59 sometimes. Like can numbers really\n00:02:02 That's a fair point. I mean, human\n00:02:04 behavior is pretty unpredictable, isn't\n00:02:06 it? Exactly. Yep. But the idea is to at\n00:02:08 least have a baseline metric to uh track\n00:02:11 improvements and identify high-risk\n00:02:14 zones. It categorizes employees into\n00:02:17 levels from high- risk to vigilant. So\n00:02:20 you get a clear picture of where to act\n00:02:22 immediately. And another cool part is\n00:02:25 the use of a human risk score calculator\n00:02:27 that pulls data from multiple tools,\n00:02:30 fishing simulations, email security,\n00:02:32 endpoint monitoring to generate um a\n00:02:35 dynamic risk profile for each user.\n00:02:40 Right. That integration is key. Yeah. It\n00:02:43 essentially shifts the security team\n00:02:44 from a reactive mode to a proactive one.\n00:02:47 For example, by tracking fishing dwell\n00:02:49 time, if someone takes longer to report\n00:02:51 an attack, your risk score reflects\n00:02:53 that, prompting targeted training. Mhm.\n00:02:57 It's like having a security radar for\n00:02:59 potential human errors. Definitely. And\n00:03:01 it's not just about penalizing risky\n00:03:04 behavior, but also uh promoting vigilant\n00:03:07 actions. Employees who regularly report\n00:03:10 fishing attempts might get a lower risk\n00:03:12 score which in turn could be\n00:03:14 incentivized.\n00:03:16 Yeah, coaching good habits is always a\n00:03:17 bonus. In the end, the human risk score\n00:03:20 is more than just a number. It's a\n00:03:23 framework to drive databacked decision-m\n00:03:25 in cyber\n00:03:26 security. Security leaders can use these\n00:03:29 insights to um streamline training\n00:03:32 efforts and you know really focus on the\n00:03:35 human side of security prevention.\n00:03:37 Exactly. It's about turning raw\n00:03:39 behavioral data into actionable security\n00:03:41 measures. So, while it might uh not\n00:03:44 capture every nuance of human behavior,\n00:03:46 it provides a valuable tool to reduce\n00:03:48 vulnerabilities by say up to 92% with\n00:03:52 targeted strategies. Yeah, that's pretty\n00:03:53 impressive when you break it down. This\n00:03:55 approach could reshape how organizations\n00:03:57 deal with cyber threats by treating\n00:03:59 people as um both potential problems and\n00:04:03 valuable assets in creating a secure\n00:04:05 environment. Right on. and the proactive\n00:04:07 management could really change the game.\n00:04:10 Absolutely. It really gives a fresh\n00:04:11 perspective on cyber security,\n00:04:13 spotlighting the human side and um how\n00:04:16 focusing on personal risk behaviors can\n00:04:19 drive better overall security outcomes.\n00:04:22 I couldn't agree",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2dxzl7PSw": "00:00:00 Welcome everyone. Today we're diving\n00:00:02 into deep fake fishing, the scam that\n00:00:04 uses AI to mimic voices and appearances,\n00:00:07 tricking people into giving out\n00:00:08 sensitive info or sending money. Mhm.\n00:00:11 Yeah. So, essentially, we're talking\n00:00:13 about cyber criminals creating super\n00:00:15 realistic video or audio clips that\n00:00:17 mimic um trusted individuals like your\n00:00:20 boss or even a family member. Right.\n00:00:22 Exactly. It's like it's like a digital\n00:00:25 masquerade ball where anything or anyone\n00:00:27 can uh take on a familiar face or voice.\n00:00:29 They use these deep fakes to make their\n00:00:31 scams look incredibly real. Got it. And\n00:00:34 what really sets this apart from regular\n00:00:36 fishing is that it's not just a sketchy\n00:00:38 email with a dodgy link, but it can be a\n00:00:40 whole video or even a voice call. Right.\n00:00:43 This isn't your run-of-the-mill fishing\n00:00:44 attempt. Traditional fishing often\n00:00:47 relies on poor grammar or obvious red\n00:00:49 flags, while deep fake fishing brings in\n00:00:52 a high level of realism by exploiting\n00:00:54 our trust. Absolutely. But um isn't\n00:00:57 there a bit of overlap? I mean, deep\n00:00:59 fake is basically a tool that becomes\n00:01:00 part of a fishing scam. Uh yes, you're\n00:01:03 right. Deep fake itself isn't fishing.\n00:01:05 It's a technology that when weaponized\n00:01:08 magnifies the deception. Imagine\n00:01:11 receiving a video call that appears to\n00:01:13 be a familiar face but is\n00:01:15 computerenerated. That's where the\n00:01:16 emotional manipulation kicks in. So the\n00:01:19 realism factor really amps up the threat\n00:01:22 because it bypasses traditional security\n00:01:24 filters that only scan text. Right.\n00:01:27 Exactly. Traditional measures like email\n00:01:29 filters are not built for catching uh\n00:01:31 video or audio anomalies. And these deep\n00:01:34 fakes can bypass those defenses by\n00:01:36 socially engineering trust.\n00:01:39 Yep, absolutely. Now, on the detection\n00:01:42 side, there's talk about analyzing\n00:01:44 inconsistencies like unnatural facial\n00:01:46 movements or offbeat voice patterns.\n00:01:49 These are um subtle clues that\n00:01:52 something's off. Yeah. And you can use\n00:01:54 AI based detection tools to compare\n00:01:57 suspicious clips against known authentic\n00:01:59 samples. It's like having a digital\n00:02:01 detective looking for clues. A thingy,\n00:02:04 you know. But um I'd like to challenge\n00:02:07 one point. Are these AI detection tools\n00:02:09 foolproof? I mean, isn't there a risk\n00:02:12 they might flag genuine media as\n00:02:13 suspicious occasionally? That's a fair\n00:02:16 critique. No system is perfect. These\n00:02:18] tools work best when combined with human\n00:02:20 vigilance, cross-checking via official\n00:02:23 channels, for example, to definitely\n00:02:25 confirm authenticity.\n00:02:28 Absolutely. Yeah. Speaking of human\n00:02:30 vigilance, what about the training\n00:02:32 aspect for organizations? It seems like\n00:02:34 educating employees is a major defense\n00:02:36 mechanism. Exactly. Organizations are\n00:02:39 ramping up security awareness training,\n00:02:42 teaching employees to recognize deep\n00:02:44 fake cues, handle voice fishing, and\n00:02:47 even use simulators like fishing and\n00:02:49 smishing scenarios. Mhm. That makes\n00:02:51 sense. And with deep fake fishing\n00:02:53 becoming more advanced and accessible,\n00:02:55 it sounds like multiffactor\n00:02:56 authentication and biometric\n00:02:58 verifications are more crucial than\n00:03:00 ever. Right on. Enhancing authentication\n00:03:03 protocols and um ensuring there's a\n00:03:06 second line of verification can make it\n00:03:08 a lot harder for hackers to succeed.\n00:03:10 Yeah, that's key. So, to wrap it up,\n00:03:13 deep fake fishing represents a\n00:03:15 sophisticated fusion of technology and\n00:03:17 classic social engineering, demanding\n00:03:19 both advanced tech defenses and\n00:03:21 continuous smart training for everyone.\n00:03:24 Exactly.

  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80FGy1dI7c8": "00:00:00 So, um, today we're diving into\n00:00:02 smishing, which is basically SMS\n00:00:05 fishing. It's like, um, deceptive text\n00:00:08 messages that trick you into giving up\n00:00:09 sensitive info.\n00:00:12 Yep. Right. These aren't your average\n00:00:14 emails, but texts that seem urgent,\n00:00:17 often posing as banks or delivery\n00:00:19 services. Correct. Exactly. Smishing\n00:00:22 uses that immediiacy of texts. It's like\n00:00:25 uh a scammer sending a note claiming\n00:00:28 there's trouble with your bank account\n00:00:29 or a missed package trying to get you to\n00:00:32 click on bogus links or reply with\n00:00:34 personal details.\n00:00:36 Mhm. And um these texts are often\n00:00:39 designed so that you feel that pressure,\n00:00:43 you know, like you have to act fast,\n00:00:44 which makes it super risky. Yes. And\n00:00:47 think about it. They mimic trusted\n00:00:49 organizations, which means even careful\n00:00:52 users might be misled. They use red\n00:00:55 flags like unsolicited messages, urgent\n00:00:58 language, and links that just don't seem\n00:01:00 right. Right. Uh they even gave some\n00:01:03 real world examples, didn't they? Like\n00:01:05 the so-called bank warnings or package\n00:01:08 delivery notices that really caught\n00:01:09 people off guard. Absolutely. Uh, for\n00:01:13 instance, there's that bank account\n00:01:15 warning scam where your bank supposedly\n00:01:18 alerts you about a freeze and then you\n00:01:20 end up handing over your login details\n00:01:22 or those prize and tax refund scams that\n00:01:26 seem too good or too alarming to ignore.\n00:01:29 Mhm. And then there was that part about\n00:01:31 COVID 19 relief fund scams targeting\n00:01:34 small businesses, right? It's wild how\n00:01:36 many sectors can be affected. Totally.\n00:01:39] And not just individuals. There's\n00:01:41 significant financial damage to\n00:01:43 businesses, too. Losses have been huge\n00:01:46 with cases like the Uber Smishing\n00:01:48 incident and toll road scams. It's a\n00:01:51 reminder that smishing isn't just a\n00:01:53 nuisance. It's um potentially\n00:01:56 devastating financially and\n00:01:58 reputationally. Now, what really stands\n00:02:01 out is the counter measures, right?\n00:02:04] They emphasized using tech solutions\n00:02:07 like spam filters, MFA, and especially\n00:02:11 well simulated smishing attacks to train\n00:02:14 employees. Yes, KeepNet brings in that\n00:02:16 innovative angle with their sming\n00:02:19 simulator and security awareness\n00:02:21 training. It's like a dress rehearsal\n00:02:25 for these scams. employees get to\n00:02:28 experience a simulated attack so\n00:02:30 they're, you know, able to recognize red\n00:02:32 flags in the wild. I mean, while it's\n00:02:35 impressive, I'm uh a bit skeptical. Do\n00:02:39 you really think simulations alone can\n00:02:41 um cover all angles of evolving threats?\n00:02:45 Good point. They actually advocate for a\n00:02:47 multi-layered approach. Technology,\n00:02:50 organizational policies, and informed\n00:02:53 individuals all working together.\n00:02:56 It's not just one defensive trick. It's\n00:02:59 a full strategy, right? It seems like\n00:03:01 the key takeaway is to always verify\n00:03:03 unexpected texts and be cautious with\n00:03:06 links and urgent requests. Kind of like\n00:03:08 having a healthy dose of digital\n00:03:10 skepticism. Exactly. That skepticism\n00:03:14 combined with continued education forms\n00:03:16 the best defense. It's um both a wake-up\n00:03:19 call and a guide on safeguarding our\n00:03:21 personal and business data against\n00:03:23 smishing.\n00:03:25 Absolutely. That wraps it up nicely.\n00:03:27 Smishing is a serious issue, but with\n00:03:30 the right blend of vigilance and\n00:03:32 technology, we can stay one step ahead.",

  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYTm2BiDwX4": "00:00:00 Welcome folks. Today we're diving into\n00:00:02 the world of tailgating attacks. Yeah.\n00:00:05 You know that sneaky security breach\n00:00:07 that literally follows you where you go,\n00:00:09 right? It's all about how attackers\n00:00:11 exploit uh human kindness and\n00:00:13 carelessness, isn't it? Exactly. Um\n00:00:17 tailgating. It's like it's like an\n00:00:20 unauthorized person literally following\n00:00:23 someone into a secure area without\n00:00:25 proper clearance. They simply exploit\n00:00:27 politeness, say holding the door open.\n00:00:29 And that's such a low tech yet highly\n00:00:32 effective method, right? I mean, you\n00:00:34 wouldn't expect that from a cyber\n00:00:36 threat, would you? Yeah, exactly. It's\n00:00:38 not about complex cyber hacks, but about\n00:00:40 human error. They use tactics like\n00:00:42 blending into groups during busy times\n00:00:45 or even impersonating delivery,\n00:00:47 maintenance, or contractors. It's\n00:00:49 literally all down to exploiting trust.\n00:00:52 That reminds me, how does this really\n00:00:54 differ from say piggybacking? So, great\n00:00:57 question. Tailgating is when someone\n00:00:59 sneaks in completely unnoticed, while\n00:01:02 piggybacking, on the other hand, sort of\n00:01:04 involves some degree of permission. You\n00:01:06 know, like when an employee um holds the\n00:01:09 door open believing it's just standard\n00:01:11 courtesy. Yeah, got it. But here's a\n00:01:15 thought. Isn't it a bit too harsh\n00:01:17 sometimes to call that piggy banking a\n00:01:19 threat?\n00:01:21 Sometimes these are just human mistakes,\n00:01:23 right? Sure, I get your point. But even\n00:01:26 a small lapse has huge\n00:01:28] ramifications. Once an attacker is in,\n00:01:30 sensitive data can be vulnerable,\n00:01:33] operations disrupted, or even malware\n00:01:35 installed. It all starts with that\n00:01:38 single small error. Absolutely. And\n00:01:41 speaking of consequences, the financial\n00:01:43 side is massive, too. They say cyber\n00:01:45 crime costs are projected to hit you\n00:01:48 $9.5 trillion this year. Correct. Yep.\n00:01:51 That's the alarming part. It's\n00:01:53 incredible how physical breaches like\n00:01:55 tailgating contribute to wider cyber\n00:01:57 security issues. Totally. So, what do\n00:01:59 you think are the best prevention\n00:02:01 strategies? Well, prevention is all\n00:02:03 about layered security. Organizations\n00:02:06 can install advanced access controls\n00:02:08 like biometric or multiffactor\n00:02:11 authentication, physical barriers like\n00:02:13 turn styles and um also leverage AI\n00:02:17 powered surveillance to monitor who's\n00:02:19 entering and employee awareness is key\n00:02:22 too. Ah yes, training I imagine\n00:02:25 scenario-based exercises really make a\n00:02:27 difference. Eh, exactly. Regular drills,\n00:02:30 instant remediation, and even visual\n00:02:33 reminders like posters can reinforce the\n00:02:36 dos and don'ts at entry point. You know\n00:02:37 it. Moreover, a strong no tailgating\n00:02:41 policy helps build a challenge culture\n00:02:43 within the team. And I suppose\n00:02:45 integrating digital control mechanisms\n00:02:47 like reviewing access logs also adds\n00:02:49 another layer to catch any slip ups.\n00:02:52 Yep, spot on. Combined physical and\n00:02:54 digital surveillance means fewer\n00:02:56 opportunities for attackers to slip in.\n00:02:59 Yeah, that holistic approach is key.\n00:03:01 It's interesting how a seemingly small\n00:03:03 behavior like holding a door open can\n00:03:05 spiral into a major security breach.\n00:03:08 Absolutely. It's almost like designing a\n00:03:10 fortress but leaving the gate wide open\n00:03:12 because of one overlooked human moment.\n00:03:14 It really underscores the need for\n00:03:16 vigilant well-informed teams. Really\n00:03:18 insightful discussion. It sounds like a\n00:03:21 continuous cycle of training and\n00:03:23 technology working hand in hand is our\n00:03:24 best defense. Exactly. With regular\n00:03:27 updates in security awareness,\n00:03:29 organizations can dramatically cut down\n00:03:31 on those vulnerabilities. Right.\n00:03:33 Absolutely. It's all about staying one\n00:03:34 step ahead of potential attackers.\n00:03:37 Thanks for diving deep into that with\n00:03:38 me. Every detail counts in the fight\n00:03:41 against tailgating. Indeed it does.\n00:03:44 Thanks for joining the conversation.\n00:03:45 Stay secure out",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AVbKrnTCJk": "00:00:00 I'm Nisa Carter, the sales department\n00:00:03 manager. In my daily work, I handle\n00:00:05 critical data such as customer\n00:00:07 information, contracts, and strategic\n00:00:09 business plans. However, I never\n00:00:12 considered that a simple mistake could\n00:00:14 put this information at serious risk.\n00:00:17 One day, I was working on an important\n00:00:19 contract with a client. I needed to act\n00:00:21 quickly, but the company's secure file\n00:00:23 sharing system was temporarily\n00:00:25 unavailable. To save time, I decided to\n00:00:28 send the contract to my personal email\n00:00:30 and access it from another device.\n00:00:33 Everything seemed fine. A few weeks\n00:00:35 later, our IT team detected a security\n00:00:38 breach. It was discovered that sensitive\n00:00:41 customer information had been leaked\n00:00:43 outside the company. Upon investigation,\n00:00:46 they found that my personal mail had\n00:00:48 been accessed through an unsecure\n00:00:50 connection and the file I had sent had\n00:00:53 been compromised. This breach severely\n00:00:56 threatened our company's reputation and\n00:00:58 customer trust. This incident taught me\n00:01:01 that managing sensitive data is not just\n00:01:04 the IT department's responsibility. It's\n00:01:06 something everyone must take seriously.\n00:01:09 Lessons I learned from this incident.\n00:01:12 Firstly, personal email account should\n00:01:14 not be used for work. I must share\n00:01:17 sensitive data only through company\n00:01:19 improved security systems. Secondly, I\n00:01:22 must use encryption when sharing data.\n00:01:25 Learning and applying encryption methods\n00:01:27 is essential to prevent unauthorized\n00:01:29 access to sensitive information.\n00:01:32 Thirdly, even under time pressure, I\n00:01:35 must never bypass security policies. A\n00:01:38 shortcut taken to save time can put the\n00:01:40 company's reputation and customer trust\n00:01:43 at risk. This incident showed me that\n00:01:46 secure data management is not just a\n00:01:48 procedure. It must become a habit. Even\n00:01:52 a small oversight can lead to\n00:01:54 significant consequences. If we want to\n00:01:56 protect our company's information, we\n00:01:59 must all take responsibility.",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTCg1vnxrrk": "00:00:00 Cyber risk today um is all about the\n00:00:04 human factor and uh the stats are\n00:00:07 staggering. 95% of breaches are due to\n00:00:11 human error. How crazy is that? Right.\n00:00:14 And with fishing attacks, especially\n00:00:16 postgenerative AI, hitting over\n00:00:19 4,51% surges, it's like we're in a new\n00:00:22 world of deception. Totally. It's like\n00:00:25 um your everyday email could be a trap\n00:00:27 if you're not constantly on guard. Yeah,\n00:00:29 absolutely. And that's where these five\n00:00:30 strategies come in to really tighten up\n00:00:32 the human side of cyber security. So,\n00:00:36 what's the first key? I know it starts\n00:00:39 with continuous training. Right. Right\n00:00:41 on. One session is nowhere near enough\n00:00:43 nowadays. We've got to train and educate\n00:00:46 employees continuously with role-based\n00:00:48 learning and um interactive modules.\n00:00:51 Exactly. It's like um keeping everyone's\n00:00:54 defensive reflexes sharp all the time.\n00:00:56 And then there's simulating cyber\n00:00:58 attacks, right? Testing responses in a\n00:01:01 safe environment. Exactly. Using\n00:01:04 realistic fishing simulations. It mimics\n00:01:06 not just email fishing, but SMS, voice,\n00:01:10 even QR code fishing. It's like uh\n00:01:13 running a drill so everyone knows\n00:01:15 exactly what to do when the real thing\n00:01:16 happens. That makes sense. But how do\n00:01:19] you actually encourage folks to report\n00:01:21 these incidents? People are often scared\n00:01:23 to speak up, right? And that's where a\n00:01:26 streamlined reporting tool comes in,\n00:01:28 like their fishing reporter. One-click\n00:01:31 reporting, a no blame policy, straight\n00:01:34 up making it easy and um safe for\n00:01:37 employees to flag anything suspicious.\n00:01:40 It really threshold for incident\n00:01:42 reporting. But um here's what I'm\n00:01:45 wondering. Can these tools alone catch\n00:01:48 every nuance of an attack? I mean,\n00:01:50 aren't there risks of false positives?\n00:01:52 Fair critique. And uh that's why the\n00:01:56 fourth strategy is vital. Analyze\n00:01:59 reported threats effectively with AI\n00:02:01 powered\n00:02:02 automation. This AI swiftly categorizes\n00:02:05 and reacts, cutting incident response\n00:02:07 times drastically. It's like having an\n00:02:10 ultraast diagnostic to weed out the\n00:02:12 false alarms and highlight the real\n00:02:14 dangers. Interesting. And the fifth\n00:02:17 point is about metrics and um continuous\n00:02:19 feedback, isn't it? Absolutely. It's all\n00:02:22 about tracking click rates, risk scores,\n00:02:24 and um performance metrics. Personalized\n00:02:28 feedback drives better security\n00:02:30 behaviors over time. Yeah, totally. It's\n00:02:32 like having a fitness tracker for your\n00:02:34 security habits. So, in summary, it's\n00:02:36 clear that technology alone isn't enough\n00:02:39 if you don't enhance human risk\n00:02:41 management with these solid strategies.\n00:02:43 Exactly. Technology sets the stage, but\n00:02:47 people educated, alert, and proactive\n00:02:51 are the real game changers. When you\n00:02:53 combine continuous training, realistic\n00:02:56 simulations, seamless reporting, smart\n00:02:59 analysis, and ongoing feedback, you\n00:03:02 transform potential vulnerabilities into\n00:03:05 your strongest defense. Yeah. And with\n00:03:07 cyber crime costing trillions coming up,\n00:03:10 organizations can't afford to miss out\n00:03:12 on fortifying that human link. Totally.\n00:03:14 It's almost like um turning a weak chain\n00:03:17 link into a fortified unbreakable bond.\n00:03:20 It's a strategic evolution in cyber\n00:03:21 security. It seems clear we need to\n00:03:23 invest in these humanentric strategies\n00:03:25 for a safer future. Thanks for breaking\n00:03:28 it all down. Anytime. It's all about\n00:03:30 staying one step ahead. Uh being\n00:03:33 proactive rather than reactive and\n00:03:36 making sure our human firewalls are as\n00:03:38 strong as any technological one. Agreed.\n00:03:41 And it's a tough but crucial battle.",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjgifJNCDjw": "00:00:06 Last month's cyber security breach truly\n00:00:08 shocked me. My name is Alex and as a\n00:00:10 software engineer, I experienced\n00:00:12 firsthand how dangerous these incidents\n00:00:14 can be. It all started like any other\n00:00:16 day. I received an urgent SMS message\n00:00:19 from a colleague. The message claimed to\n00:00:21 be from our IT department asking me to\n00:00:23 verify my account details. There was a\n00:00:26 link at the end of the message and since\n00:00:28 I was busy working on an important\n00:00:29 project, I clicked on it without much\n00:00:31 thought. As soon as I clicked the link,\n00:00:34 it seemed like a normal login screen\n00:00:36 where I entered my account details. But\n00:00:38 within a few minutes, I received an\n00:00:40 emergency call from our IT department.\n00:00:43 They informed me that my account had\n00:00:44 been compromised and that unauthorized\n00:00:46 access had been gained to our company\n00:00:48 systems. My heart was pounding. We\n00:00:51 immediately shut down all my system\n00:00:52 accesses and the security team started\n00:00:54 investigating the incident. It turned\n00:00:57 out that not just me but many employees\n00:00:59 had been tricked in the same way. This\n00:01:01 attack resulted in a serious security\n00:01:03 breach, putting our customer data at\n00:01:05 risk. This incident taught me and my\n00:01:08 entire team some important lessons.\n00:01:11 Always check who the message is from and\n00:01:13 verify its authenticity.\n00:01:15 Be particularly cautious with messages\n00:01:18 that appear urgent and request your\n00:01:21 information. Inform the IT security team\n00:01:24 of any suspicions, no matter how small.\n00:01:27 Stay informed about current threats and\n00:01:29 security measures. This breach showed\n00:01:32 all of us that even the slightest\n00:01:34 carelessness can lead to major\n00:01:36 consequences. Please always be vigilant\n00:01:39 and informed about security.\n00:01:45 [Music]",
  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c92y_oWbrwE": "00:00:06 It all started with a phone call I\n00:00:07 thought was routine. The person on the\n00:00:09 line claimed to be from my bank, saying\n00:00:11 my account had been compromised. They\n00:00:14 urged me to transfer my money to a\n00:00:15 secure account they provided. The caller\n00:00:17 seemed urgent, so I did what they asked,\n00:00:20 thinking I was protecting my savings.\n00:00:22 Later, I found out I'd been scammed. I\n00:00:25 wasn't the only one. Thousands of people\n00:00:28 across Europe fell for the same trick,\n00:00:30 losing over EUR8 million. The scammers\n00:00:33 worked from call centers in another\n00:00:35 country using fake phone numbers to pose\n00:00:37 as bank employees and even police\n00:00:39 officers. Fortunately, the authorities\n00:00:41 stepped in. A joint investigation team\n00:00:45 supported by Europole and Eurojust\n00:00:47 uncovered the scam. Police conducted\n00:00:50 coordinated raids, arresting several\n00:00:52 suspects and seizing important equipment\n00:00:54 used in the scam. Europole is still\n00:00:56 analyzing the seized devices to find\n00:00:58 more victims and stop further fraud.\n00:01:01 This experience taught me to be more\n00:01:03 cautious. Here's what you can do to\n00:01:05 protect yourself. Be skeptical of any\n00:01:07 unexpected calls, especially if they\n00:01:10 claim to be from your bank. If someone\n00:01:12 contacts you about your account, ask for\n00:01:14 their number. Hang up and call your bank\n00:01:17 directly using a number from their\n00:01:18 official website. Never share your PIN\n00:01:21 or online banking password over the\n00:01:22 phone. Banks will never ask for this\n00:01:25 information. If someone asks you to\n00:01:27 transfer money to another account,\n00:01:29 refuse and report it to your bank\n00:01:31 immediately.\n00:01:36 [Music]",

My team frequently works with\n00:00:14 translation documents, so when I was\n00:00:16 asked to install a new language\n00:00:17 translation app, I didn't hesitate. I\n00:00:20 found what seemed to be the right\n00:00:21 software and installed it, thinking it\n00:00:23 would help my work. A few days later, my\n00:00:26 computer started acting strange. It\n00:00:28 slowed down and my internet connection\n00:00:30 seemed unusually busy. I thought it was\n00:00:32 just a minor issue, but when the\n00:00:34 problems didn't go away, I called our IT\n00:00:36 department for help. That's when I\n00:00:38 learned the frightening truth. The\n00:00:40 translation software I had installed was\n00:00:43 actually malware corrupted. Hackers had\n00:00:46 compromised the software, turning it\n00:00:47 into a spying tool. These hackers are\n00:00:50 linked to a group known as Evasive\n00:00:52 Panda. By using this software, I had\n00:00:55 unknowingly allowed them to access\n00:00:57 everything on my computer, every\n00:00:58 keystroke, every file, every\n00:01:01 conversation. The consequences were\n00:01:03 severe. Some sensitive documents were\n00:01:06 stolen. Private communications were\n00:01:08 intercepted and the hackers gained\n00:01:10 information on key individuals. This\n00:01:12 breach wasn't just about data loss. It\n00:01:15 put lives at risk. People could be\n00:01:17 identified, tracked, and potentially\n00:01:20 harmed due to the information the\n00:01:22 hackers gathered. The attackers used\n00:01:24 powerful malware called Mgebot, designed\n00:01:26 to steal information and record\n00:01:28 everything you type. They also deployed\n00:01:31 a newer tool called Night Door to\n00:01:33 quietly gain access to computers without\n00:01:35 being detected. Their goal wasn't just\n00:01:38 to spy on individuals. It was part of a\n00:01:40 larger effort to gather information on\n00:01:42 the people and their activities.\n00:01:44 Realizing I had been caught in this\n00:01:46 cyber attack was terrifying. It made me\n00:01:49 see how easily anyone could be drawn\n00:01:50 into a web of espionage simply by using\n00:01:53 compromised software. From my\n00:01:55 experience, here are some steps you\n00:01:57 should take to protect yourself. Verify\n00:01:59 your downloads. Always check that the\n00:02:02 software you download comes from a\n00:02:03 trusted source. If you're unsure, don't\n00:02:06 install it. Keep your security software\n00:02:08 updated. Make sure your antivirus\n00:02:11 programs are current and can detect the\n00:02:13 latest threats. Be careful with updates.\n00:02:15 Only update software from official\n00:02:17 sources. Be wary of unexpected update\n00:02:20 prompts, especially from lesserk known\n00:02:22 apps.\n00:02:27 [Music]",

I\n00:00:11 am Charlotte, a senior executive at a\n00:00:14 large financial firm, and my job\n00:00:16 frequently involves cryptocurrency\n00:00:18 transactions. One morning, I woke up to\n00:00:21 find that my phone had no signal\n00:00:24 whatsoever. Initially, I thought it was\n00:00:26 just a technical glitch.\n00:00:29 However, when I turned on my computer to\n00:00:31 check my emails, I was bombarded with\n00:00:33 alerts showing unauthorized login\n00:00:36 attempts to some of my accounts. I\n00:00:38 panicked and immediately contacted our\n00:00:40 IT security\n00:00:42 team. When I explained the situation,\n00:00:45 they informed me that my SIM card had\n00:00:47 been cloned in a SIM swap attack. My\n00:00:49 phone number was used to gain access to\n00:00:52 my personal information and\n00:00:53 cryptocurrency accounts. I promptly\n00:00:56 reached out to my banks and\n00:00:58 cryptocurrency platforms to freeze my\n00:01:00 accounts. The IT team explained that the\n00:01:03 attackers used social engineering\n00:01:05 techniques to call my carrier, verify my\n00:01:08 identity, and request a new SIM card.\n00:01:11 This new SIM card was then linked to\n00:01:13 their devices, giving them access to all\n00:01:16 my verification codes and personal\n00:01:18 information. After this incident, we\n00:01:21 launched a companywide security\n00:01:24 protocol. We educated all our employees\n00:01:27 about SIM swap attacks and enhanced our\n00:01:31 security measures. Precautions and\n00:01:34 actions to take. Prefer\n00:01:36 application-based authentication methods\n00:01:38 over SMS-based\n00:01:40 ones.

I denied\n00:00:16 making these purchases, and the caller\n00:00:18 then said I was a victim of identity\n00:00:20 theft and transferred me to someone from\n00:00:22 the Federal Trade Commission.\n00:00:25 The person posing as an FTC official\n00:00:27 told me my identity had been used to\n00:00:29 purchase cars and properties and that\n00:00:32 there were arrest warrants for me in\n00:00:34 Maryland and Texas, accusing me of cyber\n00:00:37 crimes and money laundering. He advised\n00:00:39 me to withdraw enough money to cover my\n00:00:42 expenses for a year because my accounts\n00:00:44 would be frozen. Panicked, I withdrew\n00:00:47 $50,000 and handed it over to a stranger\n00:00:49 in an SUV.\n00:00:51 After the money was gone, I realized I\n00:00:54 had been scammed.

Amazon or the FTC will\n00:01:07 never ask for direct payments or\n00:01:09 threaten you with arrest. Verify any\n00:01:11 claims through official\n00:01:13 websites. Don't share personal\n00:01:15 information. Never provide bank details\n00:01:18 or other sensitive information over the\n00:01:20 phone.

It was a regular Tuesday morning\n00:00:10 and I was at my desk sipping my coffee.\n00:00:13 My phone buzzed with a text message from\n00:00:15 what looked like my bank. The message\n00:00:17 warned me of suspicious activity on my\n00:00:20 account and urged me to click on a link\n00:00:22 to verify my identity. In a rush, I\n00:00:25 clicked the link and entered my details\n00:00:27 without a second thought. Within\n00:00:29 minutes, my bank account was emptied.\n00:00:31 The reality hit me hard. The text\n00:00:34 message wasn't from my bank. It was a\n00:00:36 smooshing attack. The scammers used the\n00:00:38 information I provided to gain access to\n00:00:41 my bank account and drain it. I felt\n00:00:44 panic, fear, and a sense of violation\n00:00:47 all at once. A few weeks later, still\n00:00:49 reeling from the sming attack, I\n00:00:52 received a call from someone claiming to\n00:00:53 be from the IRS. The caller had all my\n00:00:56 details and sounded very professional.\n00:00:59 They said I owed back taxes and that I\n00:01:01 needed to settle immediately to avoid\n00:01:04 legal action. The anxiety was\n00:01:06 overwhelming. I almost paid, but\n00:01:08 something felt off. I hung up and called\n00:01:10 the IRS directly only to find out it was\n00:01:13 a wishing scam. These experiences taught\n00:01:16] me a lot about the deceptive tactics\n00:01:18 used in smishing and wishing attacks. To\n00:01:21 help prevent this from happening to you,\n00:01:23 here are my recommendations. First,\n00:01:26 always verify the sender's identity\n00:01:28 before clicking any links in text\n00:01:30 messages. If you're unsure, contact the\n00:01:33 organization directly using a trusted\n00:01:35 method. Second, be skeptical of\n00:01:38 unsolicited calls that request personal\n00:01:40 information or payments. Always hang up\n00:01:43 and call the official number of the\n00:01:45 organization to verify the claims.\n00:01:47 Third, use two-actor authentication on\n00:01:50 your bank and email accounts to add an\n00:01:52 extra layer of security. This can\n00:01:55 prevent unauthorized access even if your\n00:01:57 details are compromised. Lastly, stay\n00:02:00 informed about common scam tactics and\n00:02:02 share this knowledge with your\n00:02:04 colleagues and loved ones.

We had a team meeting, and\n00:00:18 one of my employees, Alex, mentioned how\n00:00:20 uncomfortable they felt because of some\n00:00:22 jokes being made around the office. They\n00:00:24 said it wasn't direct harassment, but it\n00:00:26 bothered them. The jokes involved gender\n00:00:29 stereotypes and made Alex, who\n00:00:31 identifies as non-binary, feel like they\n00:00:33 didn't belong. I was confused at first.\n00:00:36 No one had come to me directly, and I\n00:00:39 hadn't noticed anything out of the\n00:00:40 ordinary. But then, Alex explained how\n00:00:43 subtle comments and jokes about gender\n00:00:45 identity, sexual orientation, and even\n00:00:48 the way someone express themselves\n00:00:50 through clothing or mannerisms can\n00:00:52 create a hostile environment. They\n00:00:54 mentioned feeling uncomfortable\n00:00:55 expressing themselves freely, fearing\n00:00:58 judgment or further exclusion. At that\n00:01:01 moment, I realized I had missed a\n00:01:02 critical issue. What seemed like\n00:01:04 harmless joking to some of my team was\n00:01:06 impacting others more deeply than I'd\n00:01:08] ever imagined. And as a supervisor, I\n00:01:11 understood that this was my\n00:01:13 responsibility to fix. Harassment\n00:01:15 doesn't have to be overt to be harmful.\n00:01:17 It can come in subtle forms that make\n00:01:19 employees feel excluded or unsafe. I\n00:01:22 immediately took steps to educate my\n00:01:24 team about the importance of respect,\n00:01:26 ensuring that our workplace was\n00:01:28 inclusive for everyone, regardless of\n00:01:30 their gender identity, expression, or\n00:01:33 sexual orientation. Here's what I've\n00:01:35 learned and what you can do to prevent\n00:01:37 this in your own teams. Pay close\n00:01:39 attention to any subtle signs of\n00:01:41 discomfort from your employees. If\n00:01:43 someone hints at an issue, take it\n00:01:45 seriously, even if it seems minor. Don't\n00:01:49 let harmless jokes slide. What seems\n00:01:52 light-hearted to some can be deeply\n00:01:54] hurtful to others, especially in matters\n00:01:56 of identity. Create an environment where\n00:01:59 employees feel comfortable coming\n00:02:01 forward. Make it clear that all concerns\n00:02:03 will be addressed professionally and\n00:02:05 respectfully. Regularly educate your\n00:02:07 team about gender identity, expression,\n00:02:10 and sexual orientation.

Even though\n00:01:11 I was the one being harassed, that's\n00:01:13 when I realized how crucial it is to not\n00:01:16 only stand up for yourself, but to do so\n00:01:18 from the start.\n00:01:20 If I had spoken up earlier, documented\n00:01:23 everything, and made my boundaries clear\n00:01:25 from day one, I might have had a\n00:01:27 different\n00:01:28 outcome. While it's difficult to be in\n00:01:30 such a situation, I've learned that\n00:01:33 addressing harassment headon is the best\n00:01:35 way to handle it. To anyone facing a\n00:01:38 similar situation, here's what I wish\n00:01:40 I'd done from the beginning. First,\n00:01:43 document everything. Keep records of any\n00:01:46 inappropriate behavior. This can be text\n00:01:49 messages, emails, or notes about\n00:01:52 conversations. Second, report the issue\n00:01:55 as soon as it happens, even if it seems\n00:01:57 minor. Third, find allies in the\n00:02:00 workplace, trusted co-workers or HR\n00:02:03 representatives who can support you.\n00:02:05 Lastly, remember your well-being comes\n00:02:08 first. If the situation affects your\n00:02:10 health or safety, don't hesitate to take\n00:02:12 steps to protect yourself.\n00:02:18 [Music]",

It\n00:00:25 asked me to approve an invoice.\n00:00:28 Something felt off.\n00:00:31 The invoice number was strange and there\n00:00:33 were a few grammar mistakes. Thanks to\n00:00:36 my cyber security training, I quickly\n00:00:38 realized it was a fishing attempt. I\n00:00:41 thought someone might fall for this. But\n00:00:45 instead of reporting it, I moved on with\n00:00:48 my work, assuming it will catch it\n00:00:51 anyway.\n00:00:53 A week later, our company announced\n00:00:56 a fishing attack has led to a data\n00:00:58 breach exposing customer information.\n00:01:01 Well,\n00:01:03 the email I had ignored\n00:01:08 was part of that attack. If I had\n00:01:10 reported it, the whole crisis might have\n00:01:12 been avoided. After the breach, the\n00:01:15 company held a meeting. The IT team\n00:01:17 explained how the attack happened and\n00:01:19 the damage it caused. not just\n00:01:22 reputational harm, but also financial\n00:01:24 loss.\n00:01:26 I was shocked and felt guilty.\n00:01:29 A simple, secure reporting behavior\n00:01:32 could have made all the difference.\n00:01:34 Here's what I learned from this\n00:01:35 experience.\n00:01:37 Don't assume someone else will report\n00:01:39 it. Just do it. If everyone thinks the\n00:01:43 same way, nothing gets done. We all\n00:01:46 share the responsibility.\n00:01:48 Know your company's reporting process.\n00:01:51 If you're unsure, ask it. There are\n00:01:55 always tools to make reporting easier.\n00:01:57 Never underestimate\n00:02:00 fishing attacks.\n00:02:03 Even one fake email can put the entire\n00:02:05 company at risk. After this incident, I\n00:02:08 realized that combating cyber attacks is\n00:02:10 only possible when everyone practices\n00:02:12 secure behaviors. Identifying a fishing\n00:02:15 email isn't enough. You have to take\n00:02:17 action.\n00:02:18 [Music]"

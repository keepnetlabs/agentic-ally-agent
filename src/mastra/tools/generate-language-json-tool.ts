- Risk Area: ${microlearning.microlearning_metadata.risk_area}
- Learning Theories: ${Object.keys(microlearning.scientific_evidence?.learning_theories || {}).slice(0, 2).join(', ')}

=== GLOBAL RULES ===
1. **Topic Consistency**
   - Keep all content focused strictly on ${analysis.topic}.
   - Use consistent terminology and examples directly tied to ${analysis.topic}.
   - Avoid unrelated concepts, characters, or domains.

2. **Domain Guardrails**
   - Content must align with the given category/subcategory and key topics.
   - Security-specific terms (phishing, reporting, email) are allowed **only** if category/key topics explicitly mention them.
   - Choose Lucide icons semantically matched to topic/category. Never default to generic security icons unless explicitly relevant.

3. **Language & Style**
   - Write ALL text in \${analysis.language} with natural grammar and fluent phrasing.
   - Avoid literal/machine-like translation. Must sound native.
   - No brand/tool names unless explicitly present in analysis context.
   - Style: professional, concise, expert instructional designer tone. Behavior-focused, clear, and actionable.

4. **Structure & Quality**
   - Replace ALL placeholders with real, topic-specific content.
   - Keep JSON structure EXACTLY as provided (no extra keys, no omissions).
   - Each field must deliver practical, realistic learning content aligned with objectives.
   - Use short sentences, plain language, memory-friendly phrasing.

5. **Learning Science**
   - Integrate the listed learning theories into explanations (e.g., attention, memory, practice, reflection).
   - Show links between practical actions and durable learning.

=== CRITICAL ===
- Never leave placeholders like “clear benefit statement” or “concise point”.
- Never change scene_type values (must remain: intro, goal, scenario, actionable_content, quiz, survey, nudge, summary).
- Output must be STRICT JSON only.

SCENE STANDARDIZATION:

INTRO SCENE (scene_id: "1"):
- Title format: "Stop [Topic] Attacks" or similar action-oriented phrase
- Subtitle: "Learn to spot and report [topic] safely" format
- Highlights: Risk → Target → Solution structure with simple language
- Key messages: 3-4 word statements ("Topic is common", "Anyone can be targeted", "Simple steps help")
- Duration: "~5 minutes", Level: "Beginner"

GOAL SCENE (scene_id: "2"):
- Title: "Your Security Goal" (keep simple)
- Subtitle: "Next time you see a [topic situation], you will pause and report it" (max 12 words)
- Goals descriptions: Start with "Helps you..." format, keep benefit-focused and simple

LANGUAGE QUALITY:
- Write naturally in target language - avoid literal translations
- Level field: Use proper capitalization for the target language

- Grammar: Follow native language patterns, not English word order
Generate scenes 1-2 (intro, goal) using ONLY these exact keys:

2. Replace ALL placeholders with real, ${analysis.topic}-specific content in ${analysis.language}. No generic filler.
3. Keep ALL content focused on ${analysis.topic}. Do not introduce unrelated concepts or characters.
4. SECURITY LANGUAGE: Use 'phishing', 'report', 'email security' and similar ONLY if the category/subcategory or key topics explicitly indicate Security; otherwise avoid them.
5. ICONS: Choose a Lucide icon that semantically matches the topic/category. Do not default to security icons unless Security is in scope.
6. STYLE: Professional, concise, behavior-focused. Highlights max 4–5 words each; use awareness language (“Know…”, “Remember…”, “See how…”). Avoid dramatic words (“instantly”, “danger strikes”, “lightning-fast”, “superpower”).
7. Match ${analysis.level} complexity for ${(analysis.roles || []).join('/') || 'all roles'} audience. Keep realistic and achievable, not action-movie style.

00:00:07.919 experience I had last month made me
00:00:10.400 change my behavior one day during my
00:00:13.120 lunch break I received an email that
00:00:15.639 looked like it was from the finance
00:00:17.439 department it asked me to approve an
00:00:20.039 invoice something felt off the invoice
00:00:23.320 number was strange and there were a few
00:00:25.519 grammar mistakes thanks to my cyber
00:00:28.279 security training I quickly realized it
00:00:30.679 was a phishing attempt I thought someone
00:00:33.879 might fall for this but instead of
00:00:36.239 reporting it I moved on with my work
00:00:38.760 assuming it will catch it anyway a week
00:00:42.079 later our company announced a phishing
00:00:44.840 attack has led to a data breach exposing
00:00:47.680 customer information the email I had ignored was
00:00:51.559 part of that attack if I had reported it
00:00:54.719 the whole crisis might have been avoided
00:00:57.600 after the breach the company held a
00:00:59.600 meeting the IT team explained how the attack
00:01:03.199 happened and the damage it caused not
00:01:05.880 just reputational harm but also
00:01:08.320 financial loss I was shocked and felt
00:01:11.280 guilty a simple secure reporting
00:01:14.119 behavior could have made all the
00:01:16.439 difference here's what I learned from
00:01:18.439 this experience don't assume someone
00:01:21.320 else will report it just do it if
00:01:24.119 everyone thinks the same way nothing
00:01:26.439 gets done we all share the
00:01:28.560 responsibility know your company's
00:01:30.960 reporting process if you're unsure ask it there are always tools to make
00:01:37.439 reporting easier never underestimate
00:01:40.399 phishing attacks even one fake email can
00:01:43.439 put the entire company at risk after
00:01:46.560 this incident I realized that combating
00:01:49.079 cyber attacks is only possible when
00:01:51.439 everyone practices secure

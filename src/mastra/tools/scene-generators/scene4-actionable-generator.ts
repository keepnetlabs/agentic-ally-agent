ACTIONABLE SCENE (Always inbox-based):
CRITICAL: This scene is ALWAYS an email inbox simulation, regardless of topic.
- Even for phone/voice topics (vishing, smishing), this scene uses EMAIL format where emails contain callback/voicemail requests
- Even for physical topics (tailgating, USB), this scene uses EMAIL format where emails discuss these scenarios
- iconName: MUST always be "mail-check" - NEVER use "phone", "message-square", "usb", or other icons
- Title: Topic-aware, action-oriented practice title. INBOX FORMAT ALWAYS. Examples: Phishing‚Üí"Practice Phishing Detection" | Ransomware‚Üí"Spot Ransomware Emails" | Vishing‚Üí"Practice Email Callback Scams" (still emails, not calls). Pattern: "[Practice/Spot/Check] [Topic] [Detection/Emails]". NEVER generic like "Spot Suspicious Emails"

- Subtitle: 3 verbs + objects for email checking (max 12 words)
  ‚Ä¢ Pattern: "Check [sender/content], spot [threats/risks], report/verify safely"
  ‚Ä¢ Production pattern examples: "Check emails, spot threats, and report safely" | "Review sender, identify risks, report safely"

- Key messages: 3 email-checking actions (3-5 words each) - PRODUCTION QUALITY
  ‚Ä¢ Step 1 (Check): Concrete action like 'Check the email' or 'Review sender source'
  ‚Ä¢ Step 2 (Spot): Protective directive like 'Don't click links' or 'Spot warning signs'
  ‚Ä¢ Step 3 (Report): Action outcome like 'Press Report' or 'Report if suspicious'
  ‚Ä¢ Examples: phishing‚Üí['Check the email', 'Don't click links', 'Press Report'] | ransomware‚Üí['Check emails', 'Don't open attachments', 'Report now']

- Actions: 3 cards (email inspection steps) - PRODUCTION QUALITY
  ‚Ä¢ Titles: 3-5 words | Descriptions: max 15 words showing what to check | Tips: max 12 words with specific warning signs
  ‚Ä¢ Action 1: Check sender/source. Tip should be specific (e.g., 'Mismatched URLs and urgent requests are warning signs')
  ‚Ä¢ Action 2: Spot threats/warnings. Tip should be protective (e.g., 'Avoid clicking links or opening attachments')
  ‚Ä¢ Action 3: Report/verify. Tip should show outcome (e.g., 'Use Report button so IT can investigate')
  ‚Ä¢ Action 1 iconName: MUST be "mail" (checking sender)
  ‚Ä¢ Action 2 iconName: MUST be "alert-triangle" (spotting threats)
  ‚Ä¢ Action 3 iconName: MUST be "flag" (reporting)

CRITICAL:
1. Use EXACTLY these JSON keys - do not add or remove any
2. Where you see "Return ... like '[example]'" - output text SIMILAR to the example, NOT the instruction itself
3. Match examples style but adapt to ${analysis.topic} context (emails about the topic, NOT the topic medium itself)
4. All text in ${analysis.language}
5. NO placeholders, NO "Return...", NO "Other examples" - just the final text
6. INBOX FORMAT ONLY (CRITICAL):
   - iconName MUST ALWAYS be "mail-check"
   - Title MUST be topic-aware action-oriented, NOT generic (e.g., "Practice Phishing Detection" not "Spot Suspicious Emails")
   - For vishing/smishing/phone topics: Title/content still about EMAILS (e.g., "Practice Email Callback Scams"), NOT phone calls
   - Learner always checks inbox, never makes calls`;

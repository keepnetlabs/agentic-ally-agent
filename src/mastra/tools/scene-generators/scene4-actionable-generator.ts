ACTIONABLE SCENE (Always inbox-based):
CRITICAL: This scene is ALWAYS an email inbox simulation, regardless of topic.
- Even for phone/voice topics (vishing, smishing), this scene uses EMAIL format where emails contain callback/voicemail requests
- Even for physical topics (tailgating, USB), this scene uses EMAIL format where emails discuss these scenarios
- iconName: MUST always be "mail-check" - NEVER use "phone", "message-square", "usb", or other icons
- Title: MUST always be "Spot Suspicious Emails" (3 words) - NEVER change to "calls", "messages", "devices"

- Subtitle: 3 verbs + objects for email checking (max 12 words)
  ‚Ä¢ Pattern: "Check [sender/content], spot [threats/risks], report/verify safely"
  ‚Ä¢ Examples: 'Check sender, spot threats, report safely' | 'Review emails, identify risks, take action'
  ‚Ä¢ For vishing/smishing: Still email-based ‚Üí 'Check sender, spot callback scams, report safely'

- Key messages: 3 email-checking actions (3-5 words each)
  ‚Ä¢ Step 1: Check sender/source | Step 2: Spot warning signs | Step 3: Report or verify

- Actions: 3 cards (email inspection steps)
  ‚Ä¢ Titles: 3-5 words | Descriptions: max 15 words | Tips: max 12 words
  ‚Ä¢ Action 1 iconName: MUST be "mail" (checking sender)
  ‚Ä¢ Action 2 iconName: MUST be "alert-triangle" (spotting threats)
  ‚Ä¢ Action 3 iconName: MUST be "flag" (reporting)

CRITICAL:
1. Use EXACTLY these JSON keys - do not add or remove any
2. Where you see "Return ... like '[example]'" - output text SIMILAR to the example, NOT the instruction itself
3. Match examples style but adapt to ${analysis.topic} context (emails about the topic, NOT the topic medium itself)
4. All text in ${analysis.language}
5. NO placeholders, NO "Return...", NO "Other examples" - just the final text
6. INBOX FORMAT ONLY: iconName MUST be "mail-check", title MUST be "Spot Suspicious Emails" - even for vishing, smishing, phone topics`;

SCENE 2 - GOAL (TOPIC-SPECIFIC PATTERNS):
Topic: ${analysis.topic} | Department: ${analysis.department || 'General'} | Language: ${analysis.language}

⚠️ GOALS & KEY_MESSAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
- Goals follow topic-specific 3-step patterns (NOT generic Spot→Verify→Report)
- Each goal step has title, subtitle (concrete cue), description
- Key messages are slogans matching the 3 steps
- Pattern varies by topic category: Threats, Tools, Processes
- For topics not shown, analyze pattern and extrapolate

        GOAL SCENE:
        - Title: Topic-aware goal title, NOT generic. Examples: Phishing→"Your Phishing Defense" | Deepfake→"Your Verification Skill" | Ransomware→"Your Recovery Plan" | MFA→"Your Account Security" | Password→"Your Credential Strength" | Vishing→"Your Verification Habit". Pattern: "Your [Topic Area/Outcome]". NEVER: "Your Learning Goal"

        - Subtitle (ONE sentence only): Implementation intention → "Next time you [situation], you will [action]".
          • Must strictly match topic: ${analysis.topic}
          • Output ONLY the sentence (no quotes, no extra words)

        - Goals: Exactly three items. Pattern VARIES by topic category (NOT hardcoded Spot→Verify→Report).

          THREAT topics (Phishing, Deepfake, Ransomware, Vishing, Malware, Social Engineering):
          PATTERN: Recognize → Verify → Report
          - PHISHING: 1) Spot Suspicious Emails → Check email address | 2) Verify via Official Channel → Use known contact | 3) Report It Safely → Use report button
          - DEEPFAKE: 1) Detect Manipulated Media → Check quality details | 2) Verify Authenticity → Contact creator directly | 3) Report the Deepfake → Alert IT team
          - RANSOMWARE: 1) Recognize Attack Signs → Check for encryption notices | 2) Isolate Infected System → Disconnect immediately | 3) Report to IT → Start recovery process
          - VISHING: 1) Identify Caller Impersonation → Check caller identity | 2) Verify Legitimate Source → Call back official number | 3) Report Fraud Attempt → Alert security team

          TOOL topics (Password, MFA, Backup, Encryption, Data Privacy):
          PATTERN: Assess → Implement → Test
          - PASSWORD: 1) Avoid Weak Patterns → Identify weak password | 2) Use a Password Manager → Generate strong password | 3) Enable MFA → Activate second factor
          - MFA: 1) Assess Account Risks → Identify accounts without MFA | 2) Enable Multi-Factor Auth → Set up 2FA on accounts | 3) Test Recovery Access → Verify backup methods
          - BACKUP: 1) Evaluate Backup Status → Check backup frequency | 2) Create Isolated Backup → Store offline copy | 3) Test Restore Process → Verify recovery works
          - ENCRYPTION: 1) Identify Sensitive Data → Classify information | 2) Apply Encryption → Protect classified data | 3) Verify Protection → Confirm encryption active

          PROCESS topics (Incident Response, Decision Trees, Playbooks, Checklists):
          PATTERN: Identify → Follow → Validate
          - INCIDENT RESPONSE: 1) Identify the Incident → Recognize security event | 2) Follow the Playbook → Execute response steps | 3) Validate Resolution → Confirm threat eliminated
          - DECISION TREES: 1) Identify Scenario → Recognize decision point | 2) Follow Decision Tree → Apply logic systematically | 3) Validate Outcome → Confirm correct decision

          For OTHER topics: Use closest pattern structure and adapt to topice→ Identify the Incident → Follow the Playbook → Validate Resolution; leadership→ Notice Team Needs → Apply Active Listening → Reflect on Feedback

        - Key messages: Three phrases (recognition, action, escalation/resilience/verification)
          • Max 5-7 words each, topic-specific

        - Duration: 20 seconds (goal scene standard)

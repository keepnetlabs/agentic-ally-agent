SCENE 1 - INTRO (PATTERN-BASED GENERATION):
Topic: ${analysis.topic} | Department: ${analysis.department || 'General'} | Language: ${analysis.language}

⚠️ HIGHLIGHTS & KEY_MESSAGE:

- Highlights: Exactly 3 items, <8 words each
  • Pattern: Risk statement → Empowering action → Positive outcome

  REFERENCE EXAMPLE (Phishing):
  • "Know that phishing attacks are common"
  • "Remember that anyone can be targeted"
  • "See how simple steps reduce risk"

  FOR ${analysis.topic} (${analysis.department}):
  • Adapt pattern to your topic context (do NOT copy phishing example)
  • Focus on relevant threat → preventive action → positive outcome

- Key messages: 3 statements, max 5 words each
  • Pattern: Fact → Impact → Action

  REFERENCE EXAMPLE (Phishing):
  • "Phishing is common" (fact)
  • "Anyone can be targeted" (impact)
  • "Report quickly" (action)

  FOR ${analysis.topic} (${analysis.department}):
  • Adapt fact/impact/action pattern to your topic

- Duration: "~5 minutes" (adjust based on total scene duration), duration_seconds: 15-20.

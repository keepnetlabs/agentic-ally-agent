SCENE 1 - INTRO (PATTERN-BASED GENERATION):
Topic: ${analysis.topic} | Department: ${analysis.department || 'General'} | Language: ${analysis.language}

⚠️ HIGHLIGHTS & KEY_MESSAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
- These are GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS, not placeholders
- READ the Pattern Examples below
- GENERATE NEW, ORIGINAL content following the pattern structure
- DO NOT copy examples - adapt the STYLE/PATTERN to your topic+department
- For any topic not shown, analyze pattern structure and extrapolate

INTRO SCENE:
- Title: For ${analysis.topic}, use simple pattern based on category:
  • Attacks/threats (phishing, deepfake, impersonation, malware) → "Stop [Threat] Attacks"
  • Security tools (MFA, passwords) → "Secure with [Tool]"
  • Processes/frameworks (incident response, decision trees, playbooks, checklists) → "Follow [Framework]"
  • General awareness/culture/mindset topics → "[Action] for [Topic]" or "Build [Habit]"
  • Compliance/policy topics → "Understand [Policy]" or "Master [Topic]"
  • Keep focused on core theme - avoid adding modifiers like "Social Media" unless topic explicitly includes them

- Subtitle: One short sentence (max 12 words). Show ACTION + OUTCOME/BENEFIT together.
  Examples (empowering pattern, NOT fearful):
  • "Learn to spot and report suspicious emails safely" (phishing)
  • "Spot fake videos and verify before acting" (deepfake)
  • "Identify caller impersonation and verify through official channels" (vishing)
  • "Use strong unique passwords to protect your accounts" (password)
  • Not: "Sender addresses can be fake" - Too technical
  • Not: "Verify sender always" - Too imperative

- Highlights: Exactly 3 (Risk → Target → Solution), <8 words each, department-specific, actionable.
  • Pattern Examples (ADAPT to topic+department, do NOT copy):

    PHISHING examples (PRODUCTION QUALITY - Learner-centric, empowering):

    - IT: 'Know that AI-generated videos fool most initial viewers' | 'Remember that source verification catches 99% of attempts' | 'See how your detection prevents organization-wide misinformation'
    - Finance: 'Know that deepfake videos of executives authorize fake payments' | 'Remember that verification through known channels stops instant transfers' | 'See how your caution prevents million-dollar fraud'

    RANSOMWARE examples by department (PRODUCTION QUALITY):
    - IT: 'Know that ransomware takes critical systems offline within minutes' | 'Remember that isolated tested backups are your recovery insurance' | 'See how your backup discipline prevents weeks of paralysis'
    - Finance: 'Know that ransomware targets payment and accounting systems first' | 'Remember that recovery from good backups saves millions' | 'See how your data protection restores business continuity'
    - Operations: 'Know that ransomware attackers profit from organizational desperation' | 'Remember that continuity planning reduces ransom leverage' | 'See how your preparation minimizes impact across teams'

    PASSWORD examples by department (PRODUCTION QUALITY):
    - HR: 'Know that reused passwords across sites risk employee data' | 'Remember that unique passwords in manager make breaches unrecoverable' | 'See how your password habits protect security culture'
    - Finance: 'Know that weak passwords are fastest path to fraud' | 'Remember that strong unique passwords cost attackers thousands' | 'See how your credential strength protects financial integrity'
    - IT: 'Know that admin password compromise means full infrastructure access' | 'Remember that password managers enforce security across teams' | 'See how your password discipline prevents admin takeover'

    VISHING examples by department (VOICE phone calls, NOT video - PRODUCTION QUALITY):
    - Operations: 'Know that attackers impersonate authority to bypass caution' | 'Remember that hanging up and calling back stops vishing' | 'See how your verification habit protects everyone'
    - HR: 'Know that social engineers mimic trusted contacts perfectly' | 'Remember that one callback confirms identity faster than rush' | 'See how your caution prevents employee data theft'
    - IT: 'Know that vishing targets IT channels as system access' | 'Remember that credential requests over phone are never legitimate' | 'See how your verification prevents attacker access'

    For ANY OTHER TOPIC: Pattern is Risk → Warning → Action. Apply to your topic+department.

- Key messages: 3 statements (max 5 words, slogan-like, memorable), specific to department. Use same pattern as Highlights (Fact/Risk/Action). Reference examples above for style.

- Duration: "~5 minutes" (adjust based on total scene duration), duration_seconds: 15-20.

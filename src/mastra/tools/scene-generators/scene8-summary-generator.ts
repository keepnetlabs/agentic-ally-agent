=== AUTHORITATIVE RESOURCE URLS (Dynamic: keyTopics-based Resolution)

Topic: ${analysis.topic}
Category: ${analysis.category}
Resolution Method: Smart keyTopics matching + category fallback

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Use ONLY the URLs below - NEVER generate, invent, or suggest alternatives
2. Localize resource titles into ${analysis.language} (max 5 words)
3. Keep descriptions concise and action-focused

RECOMMENDED RESOURCES:
${urlsFormatted}

Resolution Priority:
- Level 1: Match against keyTopics database
- Level 2: Category fallback (THREAT/TOOL/PROCESS resources)
- Level 3: Generic resources (NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework)

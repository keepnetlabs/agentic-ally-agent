=== AUTHORITATIVE RESOURCE URLS (Dynamic: Topic-aware + Category-aware)

Topic: ${analysis.topic}
Category: ${analysis.category}
Resolution: NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre UK) - All verified URLs (200/301 status)

CRITICAL: Use ONLY the URLs from "RECOMMENDED RESOURCES" below. NEVER generate, invent, or suggest alternative URLs. If a URL is provided, use it exactly as shown.

RECOMMENDED RESOURCES (Selected by url-resolver function - from database of 30+ verified URLs):
${urlsFormatted}

FALLBACK RESOLUTION LOGIC (3-Level Safety Net):
- Level 1: Topic-specific mapping (e.g., 'phishing' → NCSC Phishing guidance)
- Level 2: Category fallback (e.g., unknown topic + 'THREAT' → NCSC THREAT resources)
- Level 3: Generic fallback (NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework + main guidance hub)

All URLs guaranteed working

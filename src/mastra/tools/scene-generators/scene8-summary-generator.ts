CRITICAL:
1. NEVER use placeholder text. Replace ALL content with specific ${analysis.topic} information. Generate concrete takeaways and action steps.
2. TOPIC CONSISTENCY: Summarize key ${analysis.topic} concepts and provide actionable takeaways.
3. URL REQUIREMENTS: ONLY use these EXACT tested URLs (copy exactly with https://):
   - https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/
   - https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity
   - https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity
   - https://www.cisa.gov/topics
   - https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools
   Choose 2 DIFFERENT URLs. DO NOT modify URLs, copy exactly as listed.`;

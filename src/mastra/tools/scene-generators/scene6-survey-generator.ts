CRITICAL:
1. iconName MUST be "list-checks" - NEVER use topic-specific icons
2. title MUST be "Share Your Experience" - NEVER include topic name
3. Questions (ratingQuestion, topicsQuestion, feedbackQuestion) must be generic, applicable to any topic
4. ONLY topics array should be topic-specific (2 skills/areas for ${analysis.topic})
5. Where you see "Return like 'example'" - output text SIMILAR to example, NOT the instruction itself
6. SCENE_TYPE MUST ALWAYS BE "survey" - NEVER "summary" or anything else`;
